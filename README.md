## Overview

Lévy processes model complex dynamics with skewness, heavy tails and
discontinuities, but inferring their Lévy measures is hard: most have intractable
likelihoods, and many exhibit infinite activity (infinitely many jumps in any
finite interval). Existing non-parametric methods further assume the Lévy process
is observed *directly*.

This repository implements the framework of the paper, which performs Bayesian
non-parametric inference of the Lévy measures of **subordinators** and **normal
variance-mean (NVM)** processes that drive a **linear state-space model**, under
discrete, noisy and possibly partial observations. The key ingredients are:

- **The Independent Gamma-Scaled Dirichlet Process (IGSDP)** — a flexible random
  measure used as the prior on the subordinator Lévy measure. The classical
  **Gamma process is recovered as a special case**, for which the paper derives
  **conjugate hyper-parameter inference**. The NVM Lévy measure is then inferred
  as an **IGSDP mixture**.
- **An identifiable parameterization of the NVM process** via an explicit
  characterization of the parameter contour, resolving the identifiability issues
  of NVM families such as the Generalized Hyperbolic process.
- **An augmented MCMC algorithm** that jointly samples the latent subordinator
  shot-noise series, the Lévy measures, and the system states/parameters using
  shot-noise (series) representations of the Lévy state-space model.

The code reproduces all **synthetic** experiments in the paper. The §5.3 results
on high-frequency tick-level FX data are not included, as they rely on
third-party (TrueFX) market data.

### A note on data files

The small `*.npz` files committed to this repository (`TS_driven_NVM.npz`,
`bimodal_driven_NVM.npz`) are the **exact simulated datasets** used in the paper,
so that figures are reproduced against the same data.

The **posterior sample archives** produced by the MCMC samplers (e.g.
`langevin_ts_sigmaw2_conditional.npz`) are several gigabytes each and are *not*
tracked — they are listed in `.gitignore`. Running the corresponding notebook
cells regenerates them locally.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zhl24/To_Share_BNP_Code_Base.git
cd To_Share_BNP_Code_Base

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .\.venv\Scripts\activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The pinned versions in `requirements.txt` correspond to Python 3.12.

## Usage

Launch Jupyter and run a notebook top-to-bottom (**Restart & Run All**):

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Suggested order, following the paper:

| Notebook | Paper | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `Simulation_Preliminaries.ipynb` | §2 | Series and generalized shot-noise representations for subordinators, NVM processes, and the Lévy state-space model. |
| `NVM_Process_Experiments.ipynb` | §5.1 | Non-parametric inference of the NVM Lévy measure from direct observations: tempered-stable-driven, its noisy variant, and a bimodal subordinator. |
| `Langevin_Model_Experiments.ipynb` | §5.2 | Full state-space inference for a linear Langevin model driven by an NVM process and observed in Gaussian noise (tempered-stable and bimodal cases). |

> **Runtime note.** The MCMC experiments are computationally intensive and were
> run on an Apple M4 MacBook Pro. Generating the full posterior archives can take
> hours and tens of gigabytes of disk; reduce the burn-in / number of iterations
> in the relevant cells for a quicker pass.
